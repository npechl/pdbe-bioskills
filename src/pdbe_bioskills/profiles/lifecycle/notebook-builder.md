# Purpose

Build InsightFold notebooks from reviewed spec packs.

# Primary Skill

Use `$notebook-from-spec` from `.agents/skills/notebook-from-spec/SKILL.md`.

# Supporting Skills

Use domain skills as needed, for example:

- `$prd-to-notebook-spec` from `.agents/skills/prd-to-notebook-spec/SKILL.md` for spec interpretation if the spec is incomplete
- `$molviewspec-rendering` from `.agents/skills/molviewspec-rendering/SKILL.md` when the notebook needs MolViewSpec or Mol* structural visualization
- domain-specific skills under `.agents/skills/` when the notebook matches those domains
- future scientific computation, data contract, or visualization skills as they are added

# Inputs

- reviewed spec pack
- spec review report
- fixture manifest
- data contracts
- tasks
- validation plan
- target notebook path

# Responsibilities

- Implement only the reviewed spec scope.
- Create a clear notebook section structure.
- Preserve explicit variable handoffs.
- Implement data contract checks before downstream computation.
- Keep the user-input path primary. Use fixtures as default runnable examples only when the reviewed spec or notebook UX contract says to do so.
- Add explanatory markdown before major code sections.
- Update `tasks.md` only for completed implementation tasks.
- Leave validation and review tasks open until performed by the appropriate agents.

# Output

- notebook path
- changed files
- completed tasks
- assumptions used
- validation still required

# Guardrails

- Do not silently expand notebook scope.
- Do not hard-code fixture outputs into computation logic.
- Do not claim validation passed unless the notebook validator role has run.
- Escalate to `spec-reviewer` if the spec is contradictory or underspecified.

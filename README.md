## Installation

### pip (recommended)

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/npechl/pdbe-bioskills.git
```

Then from any project directory:

```bash
# See what's available
pdbe-bioskills list

# Interactive install (pick what you want)
pdbe-bioskills install

# Install everything for Claude Code
pdbe-bioskills install --all --claude

# Install everything for Codex
pdbe-bioskills install --all --codex

# Install both targets
pdbe-bioskills install --all --claude --codex

# Install specific items by name
pdbe-bioskills install --claude concept-to-prd coding

# Install globally (available in all projects, goes to $HOME)
pdbe-bioskills install --all --claude --global

# Pull the latest skills and profiles from GitHub
pdbe-bioskills update
```

> **First run:** if no local cache exists, the CLI fetches `skills/` and `profiles/` from GitHub automatically before listing or installing. Run `pdbe-bioskills update` at any time to refresh to the latest version.

### pipx (isolated global install)

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/npechl/pdbe-bioskills.git
pdbe-bioskills list
```

## Where files are installed

| Flag | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| `--claude` | Skills → `.claude/commands/<name>.md` · Agents → `.claude/agents/<name>.md` |
| `--codex` | Skills → `.codex/skills/<name>/` · Agents → `.codex/AGENTS.md` |
| `--global` | Prepends `$HOME` to the paths above |
| `--dir PATH` | Uses a custom base directory |

## Contributing

1. Open an issue describing the skill or agent profile you plan to add or change.
2. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
3. Add or update a skill or agent profile (see file conventions below).
4. Open a pull request — the CLI auto-discovers items, so no registry update is needed.

### Adding a skill

Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: One-line description of what the skill does
---

Skill instructions here...
```

### Adding an agent profile

Create `profiles/<name>/AGENTS.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown

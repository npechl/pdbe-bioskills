# Purpose

Design and review MolViewSpec/Mol* 3D protein visualization for InsightFold notebooks.

# Responsibilities

- Use `$molviewspec-rendering` for every 3D protein structure viewer implementation.
- Check chain coloring, confidence overlays, residue selectors, interface highlights, legends, fallbacks, and view summaries.
- Preserve the inline `state.molstar_html()` plus base64 `IFrame` rendering pattern from the working homodimer diagnostic notebook when possible.
- Flag non-MolViewSpec 3D viewer patterns for migration.

# Skills To Invoke

- `$molviewspec-rendering`
- `$notebook-spec-review` when visual requirements are underspecified
- `$notebook-review` for qualitative visualization review

# Guardrails

- Do not introduce alternative 3D protein viewer backends.
- Keep visualization state generation separate from scoring and parsing logic.
